/*two layered approach:
 LAYER ONE:
 layer defines event loop functions for libcouchbase.
 layer exposes perl-compatible event loop API for event loop implementation
 to select() on sockets, and stop selecting on them.
 
 event loop implementation *must* keep track of an opaque object passed to it,
 and call into the 'master' XS function with the following:
    the opaque object
    the event which ocurred.
    
 this opaque object on the C end will contain the private C I/O handlers, and
 a void*-typed argument, the internals of which will be known only to libcouchbase
 itself.
 
 specifically, Perl will only know about update_event() and delete_event().
 update_event will be called with an additional empty RV - which, if needed
 can be populated with a dup'd file descriptor, available for perl to select()
 on.
 The purpose for the dup'd fd is that perl will close() it when its object goes
 out of scope. We don't want this to be seen from within libcouchbase.
 
 LAYER TWO:
 this layer defines the notification mechanism for operation results.
 
 Operation requests will involve a user-defined 'opaque' data object (SV*),
 and is asynchronously batched to libcouchbase_* functions.
 
 The cookies for these functions are special. A cookie will have a hashref
 in which it will store a Couchbase::Client::Return object for each key.
 (in the case of stat(), which is only a single command, a pseudo-key will be
 used TBC..)
 
 Additionally, the cookie will have a counter which will decrement for each
 response received. When the counter reaches 0, it means all the responses have
 been received.
 
 The cookie will have an SV* which is a function to call once the data has been
 collected for an operation. It will be passed the hashref and the user-supplied
 data
