=head1 NAME

Couchbase::Client::README - README for Couchbase::Client

=head1 Introduction

View::Couchbase is a Perl client for Couchbase (http://www.couchbase.org).

The couchbase client is a smart, vbucket-aware client. What this means is that
Couchbase::Client can tap into your Couchbase cluster, with the client needing
to be able to access (initially) only a single entry point.

This is only a simple overview of the capabilities of this module. For full
module documentation, see L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Couchbase-Client/lib/Couchbase/Client.pm>

The module provides:

=head2 Synchronous Interface: Couchbase::Client

This is the simplest and most tested interface. The methods are self-explanatory.
Additionally, the return type is complex and detailed, allowing error reporting
for any unexpected conditions (something severely lacking in any Memcache client
implementation).

I Will be using L<Devel::REPL | http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-REPL/lib/Devel/REPL.pm>
to emulate an interactive shell (the actual script to launch the shell is in
C<eg/re.pl>), where necessary

=head3 Creating a new object

    use Couchbase::Client;
    my $cbo = Couchbase::Client->new({ server => "localhost" });


=head3 Set a Value

    my $ret = $cbo->set(a_key => "a_value");

Almost every single Couchbase operation returns the common
C<Couchbase::Client::Return> object:

    $ret # =>
    bless( [
        undef,
        0,
        undef,
        "12952738923228168704"
      ], 'Couchbase::Client::Return' )

You may inspect and access the object using its methods:

    $ret->is_ok
    #=> 1

    $ret->cas
    # => 12952738923228168704

=head3 Get a Value

Now, get the key back again:

    $ret = $cbo->get("a_key");
    $ret->value
    #=> "a_value"

=head3 Object References

Transparently store references:

    $cbo->set("an object", ["Hello", "World"]);
    $ret = $cbo->get("an object");

And get them back again..

    $cbo->get("an object")->value
    #=> [ "Hello", "World" ]


=head3 Arithmetic

If the counter does not yet exist, we will need to create it

    $cbo->arithmetic(
        "my counter",
        +1, # desired change,
        0, # initial value
    )->value
    #=> 1
    # results are returned for arithmetic operations


now, increment it by 1

    $cbo->incr("my counter")->value
    #=> 2

increment by 10

    $cbo->incr("my counter", 10)->value
    #=> 12

decrement by 1

    $cbo->decr("my counter")->value
    #=> 11

=head3 Optimistic Locking

Use CAS to sure your data is consistent:

    $ret = $cbo->get("a_key");

    $ret->value #=> "a_value";
    $ret->cas #=> 7712708499878511104

    $cbo->cas("a_key", "a different value", $ret->cas);
    #=> OK

    $ret = $cbo->cas("a_key", "yet another value", $ret->cas);
    $ret->errstr #=> "Key exists (with a different CAS value)"



Try updating the key again, but using the CAS from the first operation:



=head3 Pessimistic Locking

If you have keys that will likely be objects of contention, you can use
pessimistic locking (i.e. mutual-exclusion) by using the C<lock> and C<unlock>
methods


    $lockret = $cbo->lock("foo", 10);
    if ($lockret->errnum == COUCHBASE_ETMPFAIL) {
        # something else is locking it.. maybe retry?
    }
    # lock() returns the value as well, just like get()

    my $value = frob($lockret->value);
    # Set the value. We must use the CAS from the lock operation.

    my $rv = $cbo->set("foo", $value, { cas => $lockret->cas });
    $cbo->unlock("foo", $rv->cas);


=head2 Legacy Interface: Couchbase::Client::Compat

Drop-in replacement for Cache::Memcached and Cache::Memcached::Fast.

I can't say it's 100% compatible yet, but the basic methods have been implemented.
Internally it just wraps around the new interface

=head2 Asynchronous Framework for Perl: Couchbase::Client::Async

Provides the necessary functions and utilities needed to make a POE, IO::Async,
etc. client for Couchbase.

=head2 Couch View Interface: Couchbase::Couch

Provides the methods to interface with Couch endpoints, create, modify, and use
design documents and views.

=head2 Mock Server Interface: Couchbase::MockServer

Interface to the Java C<CouchbaseMock.jar>. This is a work in progress.

=head2 Extra Components

=head3 Couchbase::Config - REST API module

This module will probably be a dependency for full testing, but will not necessarily
be part of this distribution. It's currently available as a separate repository
on github.

=head3 Couchbase::VBucket - VBucket server mapping module

Just a little utility module. May be useful for testing.

=head1 Installation

C<Couchbase::Client> depends on C<libcouchbase>. You may either use the bundled
C<libcouchbase> (which is the default installation mode), or using a user/system
installed C<libcouchbase>.

In any event, the process consists of doing something like:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Of course, the C<test> target is optional.

=head2 Using Embedded Libraries

This option is normally only available if using a pre-made CPAN distribution.
The Git repository does not contain the actual C<libcouchbase> source code, so
there are some extra steps needed. These are documented in the C<HACKING.POD>
file in the root of this distribution.


=head2 Using an Existing libcouchbase

If C<libcouchbase> is already installed, the script should detect this. If it
doesn't, you may need to pass some extra arguments to C<Makefile.PL>. For example
if your C<libcouchbase> is installed as C</sources/lcb/inst>, you'd do

    perl Makefile.PL --dynamic --incpath -I/sources/lcb/inst/include --libpath -L/sources/lcb/inst/lib

where the C<--incpath> and C<--libpath> parameters specify extra compiler/linker
flags to use.


=head2 Support

You may file a bug at the Couchbase JIRA, at L<http://www.couchbase.com/issues>,
specifying the I<Couchbase Perl Client Library> project. You may also find support in
the C<#libcouchbase> channel on L<irc.freenode.net>.
